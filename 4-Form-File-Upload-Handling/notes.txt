Sure! Let's break down the code **line by line** and **concept by concept** to help you deeply understand `Form`, `File`, `UploadFile`, and `Depends`.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Imports

```python
from fastapi import File, Form, UploadFile
```

These are FastAPI classes/functions that help parse incoming request data:

* **`Form(...)`**: Extracts form field values sent as `multipart/form-data` (like from an HTML form).
* **`File(...)`**: Used for file uploads via forms (`multipart/form-data`).
* **`UploadFile`**: A class representing the uploaded file with helpful methods like `.read()`.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. The Route Signature

```python
@app.post("/analyze-resumes/")
async def analyze_resumes(
    job_description: str = Form(...),
    hiring_type: str = Form(...),
    level: str = Form(...),
    files: List[UploadFile] = File(...),
    recruiter=Depends(get_current_recruiter)
)
```

This is a POST route that accepts:

* 3 **form fields** (`job_description`, `hiring_type`, `level`)
* 1 **list of files** (multiple resumes)
* 1 **authenticated user (recruiter)** injected via dependency

---

## üîç Now Let‚Äôs Break Each Parameter

---

### üîπ `job_description: str = Form(...)`

#### ‚úÖ Meaning:

* You expect a field named `job_description` from an HTML form submission (type: `multipart/form-data`).
* It is a **required** field (`...` means required).
* The value must be a **string**.

#### ‚úÖ Why `Form()` is needed:

In a typical web form, text fields are sent in the **form body** using the `multipart/form-data` encoding. FastAPI needs `Form()` to explicitly extract these.

---

### üîπ `hiring_type: str = Form(...)`

### üîπ `level: str = Form(...)`

Same as above. These are just more form fields:

* `hiring_type`: Could be like `"fresher"` or `"experienced"`.
* `level`: Could be like `"junior"`, `"mid"`, or `"senior"`.

---

### üîπ `files: List[UploadFile] = File(...)`

#### ‚úÖ Meaning:

* Accept **multiple files**.
* Each file is represented by `UploadFile` (not just raw bytes).
* `List[UploadFile]`: Tells FastAPI to allow uploading multiple files with the same field name.

#### ‚úÖ Why use `UploadFile` instead of `bytes`?

`UploadFile` is:

* **Memory-efficient**: file is streamed instead of loaded into memory.
* Has useful methods:

  * `.filename` ‚Äî name of the uploaded file.
  * `.content_type` ‚Äî MIME type (like `application/pdf`).
  * `.read()` ‚Äî read file contents.
  * `.write()` ‚Äî save to disk (if needed).

---

### üîπ `recruiter = Depends(get_current_recruiter)`

#### ‚úÖ Meaning:

* Inject a value returned by the dependency `get_current_recruiter`.
* `Depends()` is FastAPI‚Äôs **Dependency Injection system**.
* This is often used to:

  * Get the currently logged-in user from a token (e.g., JWT).
  * Validate permissions.
  * Inject shared resources like DB sessions.

---

## üîÑ Example of a Frontend Sending This

Here‚Äôs how a frontend HTML form might send this data:

```html
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/analyze-resumes/">
  <input type="text" name="job_description" />
  <input type="text" name="hiring_type" />
  <input type="text" name="level" />
  <input type="file" name="files" multiple />
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

---

## üß† Summary (Bullet Format)

| Component          | Role                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Form(...)`        | Extracts plain text fields from `multipart/form-data` |
| `File(...)`        | Tells FastAPI to look for file uploads                |
| `UploadFile`       | Wraps uploaded files with `.filename`, `.read()`      |
| `List[UploadFile]` | Supports multiple file uploads                        |
| `Depends(...)`     | Injects dependencies like the current user            |

---

### üöÄ Common Use Case Flow

1. Frontend sends form with text and files ‚Üí FastAPI gets `Form(...)` fields and `File(...)` uploads.
2. `UploadFile` allows you to process files without loading all into memory.
3. `Depends()` fetches user details from the request, like who uploaded the resumes.

---

If you want, I can show you:

* How to loop over the uploaded files.
* How to extract text from each file (e.g., using `pdfplumber` or `docx`).
* How to simulate this in Postman or with `curl`.

Would you like that next?


Perfect. Let me walk you through a **complete working example** of a FastAPI app where you:

* Upload a **job description and details** using `Form`.
* Upload **multiple resumes** using `File` + `UploadFile`.
* Simulate a **recruiter login** using a simple `Depends` mock.

We will:

1. Write the full code.
2. Explain it line by line.
3. Test it using **Postman** or **`curl`**.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Full Code (FastAPI App)

Save this as `main.py` and run using `uvicorn main:app --reload`

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File, Form, Depends, HTTPException, status
from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

# üß™ Simulate Recruiter Authentication
def get_current_recruiter():
    # Normally you'd check a JWT or session here
    return {"username": "recruiter@example.com"}

@app.post("/analyze-resumes/")
async def analyze_resumes(
    job_description: str = Form(...),
    hiring_type: str = Form(...),
    level: str = Form(...),
    files: List[UploadFile] = File(...),
    recruiter=Depends(get_current_recruiter)
):
    file_names = []
    for file in files:
        content = await file.read()  # you can process it as needed
        file_names.append({
            "filename": file.filename,
            "size_kb": round(len(content)/1024, 2)
        })

    return {
        "recruiter": recruiter["username"],
        "job_description": job_description,
        "hiring_type": hiring_type,
        "level": level,
        "uploaded_files": file_names
    }
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Run the App

From your terminal:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Go to: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

You'll see the Swagger UI.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Test in Swagger UI

Click on `/analyze-resumes/` ‚Üí `Try it out`.

Fill in:

* `job_description`: "We need a sales executive"
* `hiring_type`: "experienced"
* `level`: "junior"
* `files`: Upload 2 resume files (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

Click `Execute`.

### ‚úÖ Response will look like:

```json
{
  "recruiter": "recruiter@example.com",
  "job_description": "We need a sales executive",
  "hiring_type": "experienced",
  "level": "junior",
  "uploaded_files": [
    {
      "filename": "resume1.pdf",
      "size_kb": 102.5
    },
    {
      "filename": "resume2.docx",
      "size_kb": 89.2
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Example: Using `curl` (CLI)

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze-resumes/' \
  -F 'job_description=Need sales exec' \
  -F 'hiring_type=experienced' \
  -F 'level=junior' \
  -F 'files=@resume1.pdf' \
  -F 'files=@resume2.docx'
```

> üîÅ You can attach as many `-F 'files=@file'` as needed.

## ‚úÖ 5. What Happens Internally

| Parameter                                 | Type                                          | How It Works               |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `job_description`, `hiring_type`, `level` | `Form(...)`                                   | Extracted from form fields |
| `files: List[UploadFile] = File(...)`     | Upload multiple files                         |                            |
| `recruiter = Depends(...)`                | Injects user info (you can validate JWT here) |                            |

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus: Read File Content (Optional)

Inside the loop:

```python
content = await file.read()
text = content.decode("utf-8", errors="ignore")
```

If you want to parse resumes (PDF or DOCX), you can use:

```python
import pdfplumber
# or
import docx
```

---

Do you want me to show resume text extraction next (from PDF/DOCX)?


Great question! Let's break down `Field(...)` and `Form(...)` in **FastAPI**.

---

## ‚úÖ Short Answer

* `Field(...)`: used for **query parameters, path parameters, and request bodies** (i.e., model fields).
* `Form(...)`: used to extract data **from HTML form fields** sent as `multipart/form-data`.

---

## ‚úÖ Are these Default Values?

Yes and no ‚Äî they **look like default values**, but they do much more.

```python
name: str = Form(...)      # this looks like "default = ..." but it tells FastAPI where to extract data from
age: int = Field(..., gt=0)
```

* They **declare where** to pull the value from (e.g., form, query, body).
* They also support **metadata and validation**.

---

## ‚úÖ Understanding `Form(...)`

Used when data comes from an **HTML `<form>`** with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`.

```python
from fastapi import Form

@app.post("/submit/")
async def submit(name: str = Form(...)):
    return {"name": name}
```

* `Form(...)` tells FastAPI: "Look in form-data, not JSON".
* `...` means **required**.
* You can also write: `Form("default name")` to set a default value.

---

## ‚úÖ Understanding `Field(...)`

Used inside **Pydantic models** to:

* Declare **default values**
* Add **metadata**
* Add **validation rules**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., title="Full Name", description="The name of the user")
    age: int = Field(..., gt=0, description="Must be greater than 0")
```

### `Field(...)` lets you do:

| Feature        | Example                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Required field | `Field(...)`                          |
| Default value  | `Field("John")`                       |
| Title          | `Field(..., title="User Name")`       |
| Description    | `Field(..., description="Full name")` |
| Validation     | `Field(..., gt=0, lt=100)`            |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Used for          | Keyword                   | Comes From       | Required for               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Form data         | `Form(...)`               | `fastapi.Form`   | HTML form fields           |
| Body fields       | `Field(...)`              | `pydantic.Field` | Request body models        |
| Query/Path/Header | `Query`, `Path`, `Header` | `fastapi`        | Query, path, header params |

---

## ‚úÖ Final Example with Both

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Form
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

app = FastAPI()

class Job(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., title="Job Title")
    salary: float = Field(..., gt=0, description="Positive salary")

@app.post("/job/")
def create_job(
    job_type: str = Form(...),  # from form
    job: Job = ...              # from body (JSON)
):
    return {"type": job_type, "details": job}
```

---

Would you like a **visual diagram** to understand where `Form`, `Field`, and others fit in?


Great question ‚Äî and this concept is **very important** in web development and FastAPI! Let me explain in **simple terms**, then with an **analogy**, and finally with an **example**.

---

## ‚úÖ Simple Meaning

When a file is uploaded to your FastAPI app:

* If you use `bytes`:

  * The **entire file is read into RAM** (memory) immediately.
  * ‚ùå Bad if the file is large or if many users upload files at the same time.
* If you use `UploadFile`:

  * The file is **not fully loaded into memory**.
  * It's stored temporarily on **disk** (or as a stream).
  * ‚úÖ More efficient and scalable.

---

## ‚úÖ Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you're reading a 500-page book:

* **`bytes` approach**: You photocopy the **entire book at once** ‚Äî takes a lot of time, paper (memory).
* **`UploadFile` approach**: You just **open the book and read it one page at a time** ‚Äî much more efficient.

Same with file uploads.

---

## ‚úÖ Code Comparison

### ‚ùå Using `bytes` (loads entire file into memory):

```python
@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload(file: bytes = File(...)):
    print(len(file))  # File is already fully loaded into RAM
    return {"size": len(file)}
```

This works, but:

* File is read **all at once**.
* If file is 100 MB, it loads 100 MB into RAM.
* 10 users upload 100 MB ‚Üí 1 GB RAM used instantly!

---

### ‚úÖ Using `UploadFile` (memory-efficient):

```python
@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    content = await file.read()
    print(len(content))
    return {"filename": file.filename}
```

Behind the scenes:

* FastAPI uses **`SpooledTemporaryFile`** from Python.
* Small files are kept in memory; large files are **auto saved to disk temporarily**.
* You don‚Äôt use memory unnecessarily.

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus: Streaming Large Files

With `UploadFile`, you can even **read the file in chunks** to avoid loading it all:

```python
@app.post("/stream-upload/")
async def stream_upload(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    size = 0
    while chunk := await file.read(1024):  # read 1 KB at a time
        size += len(chunk)
    return {"total_size_kb": size / 1024}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Why It Matters

| With `bytes`              | With `UploadFile`              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Full file in memory       | File streamed or saved to disk |
| Slow for large files      | Fast and scalable              |
| Not scalable for big apps | Used in production apps        |
| Simple but dangerous      | Recommended way in FastAPI     |

        size += len(chunk)
    return {"total_size_kb": size / 1024}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Why It Matters

| With `bytes`              | With `UploadFile`              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Full file in memory       | File streamed or saved to disk |
| Slow for large files      | Fast and scalable              |
| Not scalable for big apps | Used in production apps        |
| Simple but dangerous      | Recommended way in FastAPI     |

---

Would you like a **hands-on demo or memory benchmark** to see the difference with big files?

Excellent follow-up! Let's break it down into two parts:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. What is `SpooledTemporaryFile`?

### üìå Definition:

`SpooledTemporaryFile` is a special Python object that:

* **Acts like a file** (you can read/write to it).
* **Starts in memory** (RAM).
* **Automatically moves to disk** **if it grows too large** (default 1 MB).

Used by FastAPI (via `UploadFile`) to handle uploads **efficiently**.

### üì¶ Comes from:

```python
from tempfile import SpooledTemporaryFile
```

---

### üí° Why is it smart?

| Behavior               | Action                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| File is small (< 1MB)  | Stored in RAM (very fast)    |
| File is large (>= 1MB) | Moved to disk to save memory |

> ‚öôÔ∏è Threshold (default 1MB) is configurable, but FastAPI uses it wisely.

---

### ‚úÖ Example (Python usage):

```python
from tempfile import SpooledTemporaryFile

f = SpooledTemporaryFile(max_size=1024)  # 1KB limit
f.write(b"A" * 500)   # stays in RAM
f.write(b"B" * 700)   # now too big, spools to disk

f.seek(0)
print(f.read())
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. What is a Stream?

### üìå Definition:

A **stream** is a way to **access data in chunks**, rather than loading the full thing all at once.

In Python/FastAPI:

* A stream means you can **read a file little by little** (`.read(1024)`, `.readline()` etc).
* Used for large files, audio/video, network data, etc.

---

### üîÅ Analogy:

| Method   | Description             | Analogy               |
| -------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| `bytes`  | Load full file into RAM | Photocopy entire book |
| `stream` | Read small parts        | Read 1 page at a time |

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Stream File Upload in FastAPI

```python
@app.post("/upload-stream/")
async def upload_stream(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    total_size = 0
    while chunk := await file.read(1024):  # 1KB at a time
        total_size += len(chunk)
    return {"total_size_kb": total_size / 1024}
```

Here:

* `file.read(1024)` gives you a **stream of bytes** in 1KB chunks.
* It avoids using too much memory.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept                | Meaning                                  | Used In                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `SpooledTemporaryFile` | Auto-switches between memory and disk    | `UploadFile.file` inside FastAPI |
| Stream                 | Read part-by-part instead of all at once | Used with `.read(n)` on files    |

---

Let me know if you want to **open and process a streamed PDF/DOCX resume in chunks**. I can show real examples.

Absolutely! Let‚Äôs create a **full working FastAPI project** where we use:

* ‚úÖ `Form(...)` ‚Äî for plain text inputs (like job description, hiring type)
* ‚úÖ `File(...)` ‚Äî for uploaded file fields
* ‚úÖ `UploadFile` ‚Äî for handling file uploads efficiently
* ‚úÖ `List[UploadFile]` ‚Äî to accept **multiple** resumes
* ‚úÖ Frontend HTML form to submit everything

---

## üéØ Scenario:

You are building a **Resume Analysis Form** where a recruiter can:

* Enter job description
* Select hiring type
* Select experience level
* Upload multiple resumes

            "content_type": file.content_type
        })

    return result
```

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Run the FastAPI Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Visit üëâ **[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)** in your browser.

---

## üß™ Step 3: Use the Form

* Type a **job description**
* Choose **hiring type** and **level**
* Upload **multiple files**
* Click Submit

---

## ‚úÖ Sample Output (JSON response):

```json
{
  "job_description": "We need a sales executive...",
  "hiring_type": "experienced",
  "level": "junior",
  "uploaded_files": [
    {
      "filename": "resume1.pdf",
      "size_kb": 42.5,
      "chunks": 43,
      "content_type": "application/pdf"
    },
    {
      "filename": "resume2.docx",
      "size_kb": 89.3,
      "chunks": 90,
      "content_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
    }
  ]
}

Let me know what next step you'd like ‚ù§Ô∏è

Great question! Let's break it down in a simple and clear way:

---

## ‚úÖ What is `response_class` in FastAPI?

### üìå Definition:

In FastAPI, the `response_class` tells FastAPI **what kind of response to send** back to the client.

By default, FastAPI returns:

* `JSONResponse` (i.e., JSON data)

But if you want to return **HTML**, **plain text**, **files**, etc., you change the `response_class`.

---

### ‚úÖ Example

```python
@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
def home():
    return "<h1>Hello, this is HTML!</h1>"
```

üîç Here, you're telling FastAPI:

> "Hey, don't return JSON. Instead, return this response as `text/html`."

---

## ‚úÖ What is `HTMLResponse`?

### üì¶ From:

```python
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
```

### üß† Purpose:

It is a **special FastAPI response** class used to return raw HTML to the browser.

### üîç Behind the scenes:

It sets the HTTP header:

```http
Content-Type: text/html
```

So the browser knows to render it as a web page (not plain text or JSON).

---

## ‚úÖ Comparison of Response Classes

| Response Class      | Content-Type       | Used For                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `JSONResponse`      | `application/json` | Default, API responses          |
| `HTMLResponse`      | `text/html`        | Web pages, HTML content         |
| `PlainTextResponse` | `text/plain`       | Raw text (e.g., logs, messages) |
| `FileResponse`      | depends on file    | Download or display files       |
| `StreamingResponse` | varies             | Large streams, like video/audio |

---

## ‚úÖ Real Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
def form_page():
    return """
    <html>
      <body>
        <h2>Upload a file</h2>
        <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/upload">
          <input type="file" name="file" />
          <input type="submit" />
        </form>
      </body>
    </html>
    """
```

Without `HTMLResponse`, FastAPI would return this HTML **as a JSON string**, not as a proper web page.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Term             | Meaning                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `response_class` | Tells FastAPI what type of response to return    |
| `HTMLResponse`   | Used to return web page content (HTML), not JSON |

---

Would you like a diagram of how responses flow from FastAPI to the browser, with different content types?

Great question!

When you hear **`multipart/form-data`**, think of it as the **special format used when a form includes file uploads** (or mixed data like text + files).

---

## ‚úÖ What is `multipart/form-data`?

It‚Äôs a **form encoding type** used by browsers when submitting a form that contains:

* Text fields (like name, description, etc.)
* **AND/OR**
* File inputs (like images, PDFs, etc.)

---

## ‚úÖ Why ‚ÄúMultipart‚Äù?

The word **"multipart"** means the request body is divided into **parts**:

* One part for each **form field**
* One part for each **uploaded file**

Each part has:

* Its own headers (like `Content-Disposition`)
* Its own **content** (the actual field value or file)

---

### üß™ Example: How Browser Sends `multipart/form-data`

```http
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryABC123

------WebKitFormBoundaryABC123
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username"

hari_putra

------WebKitFormBoundaryABC123
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="resume.pdf"
Content-Type: application/pdf

%PDF-1.4...
(binary file content)
------WebKitFormBoundaryABC123--
```

---

## ‚úÖ When Do We Use `multipart/form-data`?

Only when the `<form>` **has file uploads**:

```html
<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/upload">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="file" name="resume">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

> üî• The `enctype="multipart/form-data"` is **required** when uploading files ‚Äî otherwise, the browser won‚Äôt send the file data properly.

---

## ‚úÖ In FastAPI

FastAPI understands this format and uses:

* `Form(...)` ‚Üí to extract text fields from the form
* `File(...)` + `UploadFile` ‚Üí to extract uploaded file(s)

Example:

```python
@app.post("/upload/")
async def upload(
    name: str = Form(...),
    file: UploadFile = File(...)
):
    return {"name": name, "filename": file.filename}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Term                  | Meaning                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `multipart/form-data` | Format for forms that send text + files        |
| `multipart`           | Request body is split into parts               |
| FastAPI `Form(...)`   | Extracts text from multipart parts             |
| FastAPI `File(...)`   | Extracts file data from multipart parts        |
| Browser requirement   | Needed when `<form>` has `<input type="file">` |

---

Would you like me to break down a **real raw HTTP multipart request** so you can see what it looks like under the hood?


Great ‚Äî let's break it down **clearly** and **visually**.

---

## ‚ùì Why are these arguments here?

```python
async def analyze_resumes(
    job_description: str = Form(...),
    hiring_type: str = Form(...),
    level: str = Form(...),
    files: List[UploadFile] = File(...)
)
```

Because you're accepting **form data + files** from the frontend HTML form:

```html
<form action="/analyze-resumes/" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
```

This line tells FastAPI:

> ‚ÄúExpect `multipart/form-data` ‚Äî this will include text inputs **and** file uploads.‚Äù

So, you **must** use `Form(...)` for text inputs and `File(...)` for files.

---

## üîç Detailed Explanation of Each Argument

| Parameter                             | Type      | Why `Form(...)` or `File(...)`?     | Comes from                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `job_description: str = Form(...)`    | Text      | Sent as a text field in the form    | `<textarea name="job_description">...`      |
| `hiring_type: str = Form(...)`        | Text      | Sent as selected option             | `<select name="hiring_type">...`            |
| `level: str = Form(...)`              | Text      | Also selected from dropdown         | `<select name="level">...`                  |
| `files: List[UploadFile] = File(...)` | File List | Because `input type="file"` is used | `<input name="files" type="file" multiple>` |

---

## üîß Why `Form(...)` instead of just `str`?

Because form inputs are not JSON ‚Äî they're **form-encoded**. FastAPI **won‚Äôt extract text fields from a multipart form** unless you explicitly mark them with `Form(...)`.

Likewise, uploaded files must be marked with `File(...)` or FastAPI won‚Äôt recognize them.

---

## üß† Analogy

Imagine this:

> You are receiving a **parcel** (form data). FastAPI asks you:
>
> * "Is this a text field or a file?"
> * You must mark each item with `Form(...)` or `File(...)` to help FastAPI unpack it correctly.

---

## ‚úÖ Visual Mapping

HTML Form:

```html
<form enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <textarea name="job_description">...</textarea>   ‚ü∂  Form(...)
    <select name="hiring_type">...</select>           ‚ü∂  Form(...)
    <select name="level">...</select>                 ‚ü∂  Form(...)
    <input type="file" name="files" multiple>         ‚ü∂  File(...)
</form>
```

FastAPI:

```python
async def analyze_resumes(
    job_description: str = Form(...),
    hiring_type: str = Form(...),
    level: str = Form(...),
    files: List[UploadFile] = File(...)
)
```

---

## üì¶ Bonus Tip

If your frontend was sending **JSON** instead of form data, you would use:

```python
async def analyze_resumes(payload: YourPydanticModel)
```

But for HTML forms (`multipart/form-data`), you use `Form` and `File`.
