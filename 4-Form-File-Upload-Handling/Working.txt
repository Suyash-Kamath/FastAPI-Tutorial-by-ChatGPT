Great question!

Let’s break it down so you **understand clearly how the `analyze_resumes` function gets called when you submit the form**:

---

### 🔁 Flow of Execution:

1. 🧑‍💻 **User opens**:
   Browser visits `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

2. 🖼️ **GET request to `/`**:
   The `form_ui()` function returns the HTML form with:

   ```html
   <form action="/analyze-resumes/" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
   ```

3. ✅ **User fills out the form** and clicks **Submit**.

4. 🚀 The browser sends a **POST request** to `/analyze-resumes/` with:

   * Form fields:

     * `job_description`
     * `hiring_type`
     * `level`
   * Uploaded files under field name `files`

5. 📥 FastAPI matches the POST route:

   ```python
   @app.post("/analyze-resumes/")
   async def analyze_resumes(...):
   ```

   So this function is **automatically triggered**.

6. 📊 Inside `analyze_resumes`, FastAPI:

   * Reads `Form(...)` fields
   * Reads and streams uploaded files with `File(...)`
   * Prepares the `result` and returns it as JSON

### 🧠 Why It Works

Because of this line in the form:

```html
<form action="/analyze-resumes/" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post">
```

It tells the browser:

* **Where** to send the data → `/analyze-resumes/`
* **How** to send it → `POST` request with form + file data (thanks to `enctype="multipart/form-data"`)

FastAPI handles that POST request using:

```python
@app.post("/analyze-resumes/")
```

### 🧪 Test It Yourself

1. Run the app:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Open in browser:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```
3. Fill in the form, upload a file, and click **Submit**.
4. You’ll see a **JSON response** with details about your input and uploaded files.

Would you like the result to be displayed in HTML format instead of raw JSON? I can show that too if needed.
